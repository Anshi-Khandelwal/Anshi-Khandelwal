👋 Hi, I’m Anshika Khandelwal — a data enthusiast, aspiring AI professional, and Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern University.

🎓 As a Graduate TA for *Data Management and Database Design*, I mentor students in SQL, data modeling, and cloud-based data warehousing using tools like Azure SQL and Snowflake. I love breaking down complex concepts and helping others build a solid foundation in databases.

💼 Previously, as a System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I led data-driven initiatives — optimizing data quality, driving Salesforce Experience Cloud integration, and streamlining CRM workflows. I collaborated across teams using tools like Rally and Apex Data Loader, and facilitated agile Scrum sessions to align development goals.

🛠️ My technical toolkit includes:
- ETL pipeline design (Snowflake, Azure Data Factory)
- Cloud data platforms (Azure, Snowflake)
- CRM and data integration (Salesforce, Apex)
- Agile & team collaboration (Scrum, Rally)

🤖 Currently, I’m exploring the world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **machine learning**, and **AI**, diving deep into model fine-tuning, NLP, and the future of intelligent systems.

🚀 I'm seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my technical and analytical skills to solve impactful data and AI challenges.

Let’s connect and build something exciting!
