# 👋 Hi, I’m Anshika Khandelwal

A data enthusiast and aspiring AI professional with a Master’s in Information Systems from Northeastern University (Class of 2025, GPA: 3.8/4.0).

🎓 As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for *Data Management and Database Design*, I mentored over 100 students in SQL, data modeling, and cloud-based data warehousing using Azure SQL and Snowflake. I’m passionate about simplifying complex concepts and helping others build strong data foundations.

💼 Previously, at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I worked as a System Engineer leading data-driven initiatives — improving data quality, integrating Salesforce Experience Cloud, and optimizing CRM workflows. I collaborated across global teams using Agile (Scrum), Rally, and tools like Apex Data Loader.

🛠️ My technical toolkit includes:
- **ETL & Data Pipelines:** Snowflake, Azure Data Factory  
- **Cloud Platforms:** Azure, Snowflake  
- **CRM & Integration:** Salesforce, Apex, SOQL  
- **Collaboration & Agile:** Rally, Scrum  

🤖 I’m currently expanding my skill set in AI and machine learning — exploring Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP, model fine-tuning, and the evolving world of intelligent systems.

🚀 I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in **Data Analytics**, **Data Engineering**, or **AI/ML**, where I can apply my technical and analytical strengths to drive real-world impact.

📫 Let’s connect and build something meaningful together!
